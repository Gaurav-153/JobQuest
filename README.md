JobQuest-MERN Stack Application
**JobQuest** is a full-stack job portal built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows job seekers to search for jobs, apply for positions, and manage their profiles, while recruiters can post jobs, review applications, and manage candidate profiles.
